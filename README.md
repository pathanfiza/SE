# “⚡🔋 Electric Vehicle Charging Management System (EVCMS) Project Report 🚗💻”

## 📖 Project Overview

The EVCMS Application aims to contribute to a greener future by making EV charging more convenient, efficient, and accessible, ultimately supporting the global shift towards sustainable transportation. 
The primary goal of the EVCMS Application is to facilitate the widespread adoption of electric vehicles by providing a user-friendly, sustainable, eco-friendly transportation system and contribute to a greener future that connects EV owners with a network of charging stations allowing to Search Nearest Available Charging Stations , 
dynamic scheduling and real-time reservation of charging slots , Notification for 
maintenance and estimated completion times. By integrating IoT sensors the system can 
monitor and analyze charging patterns, predict peak usage times, and optimize charging 
schedules to minimize energy costs and reduce grid load. 
Furthermore, the application supports multiple payment options and gives 
Improved Travel Experience which supports EN route or Roadmap charging points 
(Source and destination point) and charging points along the way, making long-distance 
travel more manageable, Provides adding of favorite charging station like frequently used 
station for rebooking.
